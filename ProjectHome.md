# End of Life #
**Thank you so much for your support over the past few years! FusionLeaf is now on an indefinite hiatus. The good news is we've pulled the best pieces out of FusionLeaf and moved them in a new project called SurfStack.**

FusionLeaf Stack is the predecessor to SurfStack WAMP, a complete rewrite that runs more efficiently and provides more features to make web development easier. SurfStack WAMP is available on GitHub: [SurfStack WAMP](https://github.com/josephspurrier/surfstack-wamp).

FusionLeaf CMS will be available in modules for SurfStack Framework, an object oriented framework in PHP that supports Model-View-Presenter (MVP Passive View), a derivative of Model-View-Controller (MVC). SurfStack Framework is not available as a whole yet, but the core components are available on GitHub: [SurfStack](https://github.com/josephspurrier).

# What is FusionLeaf? #
FusionLeaf a collection of open source software for the web.

The website, www.fusionleaf.com, is now offline and redirects to this page.

# Components #
FusionLeaf is divided into two main components to simply the setup process on both Windows and Linux operating systems. Most of the development occurs on a Windows operating system because it is a very popular and easy to use desktop operating system. After development completes, the CMS is moved to a Linux operating system for stability and low cost of operations. To prepare a **Linux** operating system for the CMS, a single script runs and installs all the necessary software (very easy). To prepare a **Windows** operating system for the CMS, all the necessary software must be downloaded and configured manually (very complicated). FusionLeaf Studio simplifies the preparation of a Windows operating system by providing all the necessary software (preconfigured) in a small package.

In summary, the two components are: the CMS and Stack.
  * The CMS (FusionLeaf CMS) is a fully functional website that allows you to customize everything inside itself.
  * The Stack (FusionLeaf Stack) is a preconfigured set of tools that turns any computer with Microsoft Windows into a web server in less than 30 seconds (not required for FusionLeaf CMS, just gets it running quickly).

# Progress #
  * CMS and Stack is now available for public download in the Downloads section.

# MinnowFramework #
In cooperation with Jeffrey T Gilbert, a current version of MinnowFramework is bundled with FusionLeaf Stack in the [Downloads](https://code.google.com/p/fusionleaf/downloads/list) section. MinnowFramework is a powerful framework with usability and practical application in mind. Unlike many other MVC frameworks, MinnowFramework supports amazing code completion in popular IDE's like Eclipse. It also includes social authentication and integration with services: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Live, MySpace, and Foursquare. The homepage for MinnowFramework can be found here: https://github.com/jeffreytgilbert/MinnowFramework
